## Design choices

- choosing tech stack I went for Express.js, because every other choice looked like an overkill to me
- instead of wrapping every `await` call in try/catch statement, I decided to wrap every controller that makes such a call around a higher-order function that has only one purpose: to intercept potential Promise rejection and pass the resulting error down to the error handling middleware: <br>

```javascript
export const catchErrors = controller => (req, res, next) =>
  controller(req, res, next).catch(next)
```

> I belive it decouples the business logic from error handling code and nicely follows the Separation of Concerns concepts.

- at some point I realised that common DAO code could be extracted providing some reusability. That's how `getOne, getAll` and `findBy` methods got refactored out. This way, adding a new resource will just be a matter of implementing code that fetches the resource from any data structure (responsibility of the model), and the controller will be generated 'metaprogramatically' by calling `createDaoFor` method. Having this in place, the code can be easily expanded to provide the rest of the REST functionality.
- every file that has been used throughout the development process is checked out to github (except for .env)
